                    <h3>Your best web developer</h3>
                    <p>Hi! I am na aspiring front end developer with passion for good quality code and attention to detail. 
                    I am an organized and responsible person, caring about the quality of my performance. I find myself working very well both independently and in a team. </p>
                    <p>I am a student of Warsaw University of Technology majoring in biomedical engineering. This led me to gain sufficient knowledge in a range of technical and scientific fields. I enjoy travelling not only as a hobby, byt also as a way to further educate myself.  During the student  exchange in the Erasmus programme at the Danish Technical University I had the opportunity to take part in various projects  and improve my knowledge of English, both in speech and in writing. During my participation in ATHENS programme I had an opportunity to meet students from all over Europe and collaborated with them on assigned projects.</p> 
                    <p>For the last two years I have been consistently improving my level of German by taking part in  language courses and solving tests. </p>
                    <h3>I do have a very particular set of skills</h3>
                    <p>I have started my web development journey in the 6th grade of primary school coding my first website in <strong>HTML</strong>. Later on I learnt <strong>CSS</strong> to beautify my teenage blog. Last year I participated in <a href="http://codecarrotsjs.github.io/">Code Carrots JavaScript</a> course, which gave me good foundation of <strong>JS</strong> knowledge. I learnt about DOM, object oriented programming, <strong>GIT</strong>. I know now the basics of <strong>jQuery</strong> and even a little bit of AngularJS. I am able to write my projects' documentation using Github's gist and markdown.</p>
                    <p>During April-August 2016 I worked as a front-end intern at <a href="http://www.codilime.com">CodiLime</a>, where I joined a team developing a web application using <strong>CoffeeScript</strong>, HTML5, Sass, AngularJS. I have gained sufficient knowledge of <strong>AngularJS</strong> and experience writing unit tests using <strong>Jasmine</strong>. I am now familiar with GIT workflow and the concept of feature branches as well as with Atlassian tools sucha as <strong>Jira</strong>, Confluence, Bitbucket. I learnt good coding practices during <strong>code reviews</strong>.</p>
                    <p>I am a fast learner, my willingness to learn and discover new things drives me to improve and challenge myself constantly. I work efficiently under stress and organise my time well.</p>
